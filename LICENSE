## Notes

- Callouts Evolved is free to use, and will remain free to use indefinitely.
- A paid version is available to unlock additional features. Pull requests that make paid features free or create database tasking features or features that would encourage trolls to abuse the free version of the site will never be merged with the main branch.
- This will become an open-source project in 2023, which allows you to learn from (and contribute to) the communication interface.
- But Callouts Evolved and it's extensions will not be permissively licensed!
- The long-term plan is to eventually open the license up to something really
  permissive (probably MIT), when the site is closer to feature-complete.
- In the near-term I would like to avoid forks of the website, since I feel it
  would cause confusion in the community to have several similar-but-different
  communication interfaces available. If you have a really good idea, I'd be happy to pay you for it!
